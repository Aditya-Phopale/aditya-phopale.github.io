My name is Aditya Phopale. I hold a Master's (Hons.) in Computational Science and Engineering from the Technical University of Munich, Germany, and am currently working as a Research Assistant under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Jianxun Wang](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/jian-xun-wang/) at the University of Notre Dame, USA. My academic journey began with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, India.

I am passionate about research that lies at the intersection of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and machine learning. My current focus is on neural operators, and I am particularly excited about the emerging possibilities of using generative AI to understand and predict chaotic turbulent flows.
