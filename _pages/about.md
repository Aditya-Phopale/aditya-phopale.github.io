My name is Aditya Phopale. I hold a Master's (Hons.) in Computational Science and Engineering from the Technical University of Munich, Germany. My academic journey began with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, India.

I am passionate about research that lies at the intersection of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and machine learning. My current focus is on neural operators, and I am particularly excited about the emerging possibilities of using generative AI to understand and predict chaotic turbulent flows.
