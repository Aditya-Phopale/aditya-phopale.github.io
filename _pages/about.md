I am Aditya Phopale. I have completed my Masters (Hons.) in Computational Science and Engineering at the Technical University of Munich, Germany. Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Jianxun Wang](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/jian-xun-wang/) from the University of Notre Dame, USA. Initially, I studied Mechanical Engineering at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, India.

I am interested in the research at the intersection of CFD and machine learning, particularly in Neural Operators and am also interested in upcoming research areas of using generative AI methods to learn the distribution of chaotic turbulent flows.
