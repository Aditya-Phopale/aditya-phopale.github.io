I am Aditya Phopale. I have completed my Masters (Hons.) in Computational Science and Engineering at the Technical University of Munich, Germany. Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Jianxun Wang from the University of Notre Dame, USA. Initially, I studied Mechanical Engineering at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science ,India. 

I am interested in the research at the intersection of CFD and machine learning, particularly in Neural Operators and using generative AI methods to learn the distribution of chaotic turbulent flows.
